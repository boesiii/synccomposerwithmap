description=Sync the map canvas extents with composer map
about=This plugin, when activated, will get the extents and scale of the current map canvas and synchronize those values with a map in the Composer.  If you have multiple maps in Composer and would like to schronize a specific map, select the map in composer and activate plugin.  The plugin is similar to the "Set to map canvas extent" button found in Item Properties in Composer but is easier to find for non-GIS proffessionals.
